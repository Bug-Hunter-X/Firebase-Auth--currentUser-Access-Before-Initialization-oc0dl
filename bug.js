The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the `currentUser` property is accessed before the authentication state is fully initialized.  This can happen if you try to access `auth.currentUser` immediately after initializing Firebase or within an asynchronous operation before the authentication state has been resolved. This leads to a null pointer exception or unexpected behavior.

Example of problematic code:
```javascript
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const user = firebase.auth().currentUser; // Accessing currentUser too early
console.log(user.email); // This might throw an error because user is null
```
