The correct approach involves using the `onAuthStateChanged` listener to handle changes in the authentication state. This ensures that the `currentUser` property is only accessed after the authentication state has been fully initialized.

Here's how to fix the code:
```javascript
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
if (user) {
  // User is signed in, see docs for a list of available properties
  // https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.User
  console.log(user.email);
} else {
  // User is signed out
  // ...
}
});
```
This revised code ensures that `user` is only accessed after the authentication state is determined, preventing unexpected errors.
